LINUX began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish sudent Linus Torvlads: to create a new free operating system kernel. The resulting LINUX Kernel has been marked by constant growth throughtout s history. Since the inial release of s source code in 1991,  has grown from a small number of C files under a license prohibing commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 wh more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments, under the GNU General Public License v2 

After AT&T had dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating system was conceived and implemented by Ken Tompson and Dennis Rchie (both of AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later they rewrote  in a new programming language, C, to make  portable. The availabily and portabily of Unix caused  to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic instutions and businesses
